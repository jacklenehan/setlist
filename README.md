## Setlist

Have you ever wanted to arrange a setlist or a playlist in Spotify by BPM - one of the key ingredients in building and releasing tension - and had to juggle a Google Doc, a Sort Your Music or SongBPM window, and the Spotify client? Have you ever done so without a wifi connection and lived in mortal fear that an accidental Ctrl-W press would sink the whole enterprise?

Well look no further! Setlist provides import functionality, an easy drag-and-drop interface, and LocalStorage backup to allow you to sort your playlist by BPM metadata that you enter.
